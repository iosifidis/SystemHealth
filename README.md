## Acknowledgment

My advice is not to execute commands and scripts you find on the Internet without studying what effect the commands you execute will have. It may damage your system. In this particular case, I bear no responsibility if this is done.

## Usage

1. Download the file.  

2. Make it executable with the command.

chmod +x mysystemhealth

3. You can run it using the command

## Use as the root user.

You better copy the file to your **/usr/bin** folder.

sudo cp mysystemhealth /usr/bin/
